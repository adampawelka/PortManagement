The system aims to support sustainable and intelligent port logistics, providing tools for planning,
scheduling, and monitoring vessel visits, cargo handling, and the allocation of logistic resources.
Modern ports are complex environments, as the study (to be carried out) of the selected company in
the ports management sector will help to better understand, where multiple actors — including port
authorities, shipping agents, and logistics operators — must coordinate efficiently to ensure timely
vessel turnaround, optimal resource usage, and compliance with safety and environmental standards.
By addressing these challenges, the system contributes to improved operational efficiency and more
sustainable management practices. Furthermore, GDPR compliance must be addressed, ensuring the
system meets data protection and consent management requirements of all individuals involved in
port operations.

Focusing on port operations, the system manages vessels, their scheduled visits, associated cargo, and
the execution of loading and unloading tasks. Each visit involves coordination of limited resources
such as docks, cranes, trucks, and warehouses, and requires careful sequencing to maintain smooth
operations. The system must not only manage the basic registration and validation of vessel visits but
also provide intelligent support for dock assignment, task sequencing, and resource allocation,
ensuring that port operations remain feasible and well-coordinated across stakeholders. Additionally,
3D visualization and interaction features are included, allowing users to observe vessel positions,
container locations, and resource allocations in a realistic and interactive digital representation of the
port. The system design should also consider disaster recovery and business continuity, ensuring that
operations can be restored quickly in case of failures or emergencies.

The prototype must be a modular web-based system, integrating all core functionalities in a way that
demonstrates the feasibility of the system in a simplified but realistic context. It should support both
traditional management operations and innovative aspects, such as employing advanced scheduling
algorithms and leveraging visualization and interactive tools to enhance operational decision-making.

# Business Overview
For clarity, the business is described by introducing the main areas/concerns of the business
throughout the next subsections.

## Port Structure and Facilities
A modern port is organized into distinct areas to facilitate the arrival, (un)loading, storage, and
departure of vessels efficiently. The main components include docks (or quays) where vessels berth
for loading and unloading operations, container yards for temporary storage of containers, and
Note: The system described next is a big simplification of what is traditionally a port logistics
management system. Simplifications are made, on one hand, to turn the project feasible within
the scope of the LEI semester and, on other hand, to focus on some innovative aspects. As so,
you should pay attention to the simplifications and assumptions presented throughout the
system description warehouses for cargo requiring additional handling or inspection. The Port Authority is responsible for
managing these facilities, ensuring that docks are allocated appropriately, yard capacity is monitored,
and warehouses are operated according to port regulations and safety standards. These facilities form
the backbone of port operations and serve as the primary locations where resources and tasks are
coordinated, making them central to any system designed to support port logistics.

### Logistic Resources
Efficient port operations depend either on physical resources and on human resources

### Physical Resources
Efficient operation of a port relies on a variety of logistic resources used to move cargo between
vessels, yards, and warehouses. Among the most critical are ship-to-shore (STS) cranes, which are
large fixed cranes permanently installed at the docks and used to lift containers directly on and off
vessels. Each dock has its own number of STS cranes — for instance, one dock might have a single
crane, another might have two, and a larger dock could be equipped with five or more. When a vessel
is assigned to a dock, the maximum number of STS cranes available for its operations is defined by
that dock’s infrastructure.

In addition to these fixed cranes, ports rely on mobile resources such as yard gantry cranes (for
stacking and moving containers within yards) and trucks or terminal tractors (for transporting
containers between docks, yards, and warehouses). These mobile resources are managed by the
Logistics Operator, who is responsible for allocating them to specific tasks during a vessel visit. Since
their availability is limited, and they are shared across all operations in the port, their allocation must
be carefully planned and coordinated. For example, while multiple STS cranes may unload containers
in parallel, trucks must be scheduled to immediately transfer them to the yard to prevent congestion
at the dock. The system must therefore consider both the fixed constraints of dock infrastructure and
the flexible allocation of mobile resources to ensure smooth port operations.

Resource characteristics directly affect the planning and execution of loading and unloading tasks.
Each resource registered in the system must capture a set of standardized attributes that allow both
day-to-day management and the later application of intelligent scheduling and planning algorithms
such as:
> - Operational Window (weekly basis): Each resource (crane, truck, or other equipment) has defined
periods of availability across the week, reflecting shifts, maintenance periods, or contractual usage
limits. For example, a truck may be available Monday to Friday from 08:00 to 20:00, while a crane
may operate in continuous 24/7 shifts.
> - Operational Capacity (type-dependent):
>> Cranes: Measured in average containers per hour, depending on the type (STS cranes
usually achieve higher throughput than yard cranes).
>> Trucks: Measured in containers per trip and average speed per hour.
> - Current Availability Status: Resources can be marked as available, unavailable (maintenance), or
temporarily out of service.
> - Operating Staff Requirements: Some resources require dedicated staff. For example, each STS
crane must be operated by a certified crane operator, while each truck requires a driver.
> - Setup Time: Certain resources need preparation before becoming operational. For example, crane
may require calibration, while trucks may need refueling or repositioning. Setup time must be
accounted for when planning task sequences.

### Human Resources (Operating Staff)

As stated, efficient port operations not only depend on physical resources but also on the availability
and proper assignment of qualified staff (human resources). Since many resources cannot function
autonomously, the system must incorporate operating staff management information to support
realistic scheduling and allocation. Despite their identification and contact data such as the
mecanographic number, short name, email and phone, it is necessary to capture:
> - Operational Window: Like physical resources, operating staff have weekly schedules that define
their availability (e.g., “Monday–Friday, 08:00–16:00”).
> - Qualification: Each staff member is registered with the qualifications they hold (e.g., STS crane
operator, yard gantry cranes operator, truck driver, yard planner). Certain resources may only be
operated by staff with matching qualifications (e.g., an STS crane requires a certified STS crane
operator).
> - Current Status: Staff may be marked as available, unavailable (on leave, training), or temporarily
reassigned.

By capturing these (and possibly other) details, the system might be able to prevent unrealistic plans
(e.g., assigning five cranes when only three certified crane operators are available). This also provides
flexibility for exploring scenarios where human resources are the actual bottleneck, not equipment,
which is often the case in real port operations.

## Vessels
Ports receive a wide variety of vessels, ranging from small feeder ships to large ocean-going container
vessels. Each vessel is uniquely identified by an IMO (International Maritime Organization) number,
which serves as its international registration and is linked to national or regional maritime authorities.
The size, type, and cargo capacity of a vessel strongly influence its operational needs at the port, such
as the length of dock required, the number of STS cranes that can be engaged, and the volume of
containers to be handled.

Although ports handle many vessel categories, the system will focus mainly on container-carrying
vessels, since they are the most common in modern commercial ports. Examples include feeder
vessels (small ships serving regional routes and connecting to larger ports), Panamax vessels (the
maximum size that fits through the old Panama Canal locks, typically carrying ~5,000 containers), Post-
Panamax vessels (larger, requiring deeper berths and more cranes), and Ultra Large Container Vessels
(ULCVs) (capable of carrying 18,000+ containers, requiring extensive dock space and simultaneous use
of multiple cranes).

Cargo on these vessels is stored in containers, which may vary in size (e.g., 20-foot, 40-foot). To
simplify, the prototype will adopt the TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit) as the standard
measurement, assuming all containers have the same dimension. Containers are organized into a grid-
like structure on board, divided into bays (lengthwise sections of the ship), rows (across the width),
and tiers (vertical stacks above and below deck). The type of vessel determines the maximum number
of rows, bays, and tiers, and therefore its maximum TEU capacity. For example, a feeder vessel may
only support a small grid, while a ULCV may span dozens of bays and rows with multiple tiers. This
structure directly affects loading and unloading operations, since containers in lower tiers or inner
rows cannot be accessed until those above or outside them are removed.

## Shipping Agents
Shipping agents are organizations that represent vessel owners or operators in port operations. Their
primary responsibility is to coordinate administrative and operational tasks associated with a vessel
visit, including submitting Vessel Visit notifications and providing cargo information in compliance
with port regulations. Each shipping agent organization may have multiple representatives authorized
to interact with the system on its behalf.

The registration of shipping agent organizations and their representatives is handled by the Port
Authority, which validates their credentials before they can submit Vessel Visit notifications. To be
authorized to act on behalf of a vessel, a shipping agent must submit a simple request to the Port
Authority along with the proper documentation. This request is then either accepted or rejected.
Currently, a vessel can be represented by only one shipping agent organization at a time. This ensures
accountability and compliance with official maritime records while granting representatives the ability
to submit Vessel Visit notifications for their assigned vessels.

## Vessel Visits
A Vessel Visit represents the planned arrival and departure of a vessel at the port, including associated
operations such as cargo loading and unloading. The process begins when a shipping agent
representative submits a Vessel Visit notification for an authorized vessel, providing key information
such as expected arrival (ETA), departure (ETD), cargo type and volume, and any special handling
requirements.

Additionally, a Vessel Visit Notification may also include basic crew information to support regulatory
and operational needs. For most visits, this information is limited to the captain’s name and the total
number of crew members on board However, when the vessel carries dangerous cargo, the 
notification must explicitly identify the designated crew safety officers, as their presence is a
prerequisite for port operations involving hazardous materials.

The Port Authority reviews the notification and decides to approve or reject it. If the visit is rejected,
a reason must be provided to the agent, such as missing documentation or dock unavailability. If the
visit is approved, a dock is assigned, potentially with support from an intelligent algorithm that
considers pending visits, vessel type, dock capacity, and other operational constraints.

Once a dock is assigned, operational tasks — such as unloading containers, moving cargo to yards, and
allocating cranes and trucks — are defined and scheduled by the Logistics Operator. For example, if a
feeder vessel is approved and assigned to Dock A, the tasks of unloading containers with the available
STS crane and transporting them to the yard are planned in sequence, taking into account
parallelization rules and resource availability.

Yet, it is worth keeping in mind that operational conditions may change (e.g., a dock becomes
unavailable due to maintenance or the arrival of a priority vessel). In such cases, the visit may be
rescheduled to another dock, or its planned tasks adjusted, while maintaining the overall integrity of
port operations. For instance, a feeder vessel expected at Dock A with a single STS crane may be
reassigned to Dock B if Dock A undergoes unexpected maintenance, ensuring that unloading and
loading operations can continue with minimal disruption.

## Cargo and Cargo Manifest
Cargo Manifests are submitted by the shipping agent together with the Vessel Visit notification and
serve as the primary input for the Logistics Operator when defining operational tasks. Each manifest
provides structured information about the containers involved, including their number, contents (e.g.,
description and cargo type), and positions on the vessel (organized by bays, rows, and tiers). Typical
cargo types include refrigerated goods (reefers), general consumer products, electronics, hazardous
materials (HAZMAT), and oversized industrial equipment.

To ensure global interoperability and accuracy in cargo handling, containers are identified using the
ISO 6346:2022 standard. This standard defines a unique identifier composed of an owner code (three
letters), an equipment category identifier (one letter, such as “U” for freight containers), a six-digit
serial number, and a single check digit for validation. These globally recognized codes serve as the key
reference for all container-related operations, including manifests, yard storage, and vessel
loading/unloading.

Cargo manifests can take two forms:
> - Unloading Manifest – lists all containers to be offloaded from the vessel upon arrival. For
example, a manifest entry might specify container ID MSKU3881445, located at bay 5, row 8, tier
3, containing refrigerated fruit destined for Warehouse A. This information allows the operator to
plan unloading sequences and allocate cranes and trucks efficiently.
> - Loading Manifest – lists all containers to be loaded onto the vessel for departure. For instance, an
entry could indicate container ID CMAU1234567, currently at Yard B, containing electronics, to be
loaded at bay 6, row 12, tier 2. This ensures proper sequencing, vessel stability, and efficient
resource allocation. A Vessel Visit may include one cargo manifest (either unloading or loading), two cargo manifests (both
unloading and loading), or none (e.g., maintenance calls).
> - Scheduling and Planning Operations
Efficient port operations require careful scheduling and planning to coordinate vessels, docks, cargo
handling, and logistic resources. This involves two complementary levels of planning:
> * 1. Port Authority Level – Dock Assignment Algorithm
Once a Vessel Visit is approved, the Port Authority assigns a dock to the vessel. As previously
stated, this process can be supported by an intelligent algorithm that considers pending visits,
vessel type, expected cargo volume, dock capacity, and other constraints. The algorithm helps
optimize dock usage, prevent conflicts, and ensure timely vessel turnaround. For example, if two
vessels of similar size but carrying different volumes of cargo are scheduled to arrive at
overlapping times, the algorithm may assign the vessel with more cargo to a dock equipped with
more STS cranes, while directing the other vessel to a different suitable dock to optimize unloading
efficiency.
> * 2. Logistics Operator Level – Resource Allocation and Task Sequencing Algorithm
After a dock is assigned and cargo manifests are available, the Logistics Operator defines
operational tasks such as unloading containers, moving them to yards or warehouses, and loading
outbound containers. An intelligent scheduling algorithm supports this process by sequencing
tasks and allocating limited resources — cranes, trucks, yard equipment, operating staff — while
respecting dependencies (e.g., containers in lower tiers cannot be unloaded until those above are
removed). This ensures efficient parallelization of operations and minimizes delays.

During scheduling, the binding between staff and resources is a critical constraint. The system must
therefore ensure that each resource (e.g., a crane or a truck) is matched with the required (number
of) qualified staff members whose availability overlaps with the resource’s operational window.
In short, the step-by-step unloading process is as follows:
> - 1. From Vessel to Dockside
• STS cranes lift containers from the vessel.
• Each crane is operated by a crane operator.
• Containers are placed on terminal trucks waiting dockside.
> - 2. From Dockside to Yard
• Trucks transport containers from the dock edge to the container yard.
• Containers are stacked in the yard using yard gantry cranes.
> - 3. From Yard to Warehouse/Outside Port
Depending on the cargo, containers may:
> * Stay in the yard until picked up by external trucks or trains.
> * Be moved to a warehouse inside the port for customs inspection, consolidation, or unpacking.
> * Be sent directly to hinterland transportation (rail or long-haul trucks).

The loading process is similar to this, but in the reverse order — containers move from yard or
warehouse to the dockside, are loaded onto the vessel according to the loading manifest, and placed
in the assigned bays, rows, and tiers.

By combining these two algorithms, the system ensures that dock assignments and resource
scheduling are coordinated, that cargo is handled in the correct order, and that port operations remain
feasible and efficient under both normal and dynamic conditions.

## Actors and Roles

The system to be developed must support different user profiles, with the features available to each
user depending on their profile. The main profiles and their responsibilities are:
> -  Port Authority Officer: responsible for reviewing and approving or rejecting Vessel Visit
notifications submitted by shipping agents, assigning docks to approved visits (potentially with
algorithmic support), and overseeing port operations for compliance with safety, environmental,
and operational regulations. Officers can also manage shipping agent registrations and vessel
authorizations.
> - Shipping Agent Representative: responsible for submitting Vessel Visit notifications and
associated Cargo Manifests for vessels they are authorized to represent. They can update or
cancel notifications before approval, provide required documentation, and monitor the status of
approved visits.
> - Logistics Operator: responsible for defining and scheduling operational tasks for approved Vessel
Visits, including unloading, loading, and resource allocation (cranes, trucks, yard equipment).
Operators monitor the execution of tasks, handle adjustments due to changing operational
conditions, and ensure that cargo moves efficiently through docks, yards, and warehouses.
> - Administrator: responsible for managing user accounts and permissions, ensuring that each
profile has access only to the functions appropriate to their role. Administrators also configure
general system parameters and maintain the integrity of operational data.
Each user profile interacts with the system through a Single Page Application (SPA), with access and
features adapted to their responsibilities. Moreover, it is expected that:
> - User authentication relies on an external Identity and Access Management (IAM) provider (e.g.,
Google, Microsoft, Facebook), ensuring secure and centralized user verification; while 
> - User authorization, i.e. determining which features and data each user can access, is managed
internally by the system according to their profile and assigned permissions, enforcing role-based
access control across all modules.

## Other Requirements
Beyond functional features, the system to be developed must also comply with a set of cross-cutting
requirements aiming to ensure its quality, sustainability, and alignment with real-world expectations.
Usability is a primary concern: the web interface should provide a consistent, intuitive, and responsive
user experience, enabling different actors to accomplish their tasks efficiently with minimal training.
Since the port context is inherently international, the system must support multilingual operation, at
least in English and Portuguese, and be easily extendable to other languages if needed.

All user interactions must be carefully logged, producing detailed records of every significant action
performed in the system. These logs are not only essential for auditing and traceability but also serve
as an important tool for diagnosing issues and analyzing user behavior. Communication and
integration must follow well-established standards, with the adoption of RESTful APIs and other
industry best practices that guarantee interoperability with external and internal systems /
applications and services. Likewise, documentation is expected to be up-to-date and aligned with
recognized models (e.g., C4 model) and notations (e.g., UML, OpenAPI), ensuring clarity and
maintainability. In this respect, particular care must be given to documenting the high-level system
architecture and the exposed APIs.

Security and compliance are also crucial. To achieve this, the team is expected to identify and mitigate
risks such as unauthorized access, data breaches, or denial-of-service attacks from the earliest stages
of system development, ideally starting at the design level. Compliance with applicable laws and
regulations, particularly the GDPR, must be ensured, which implies careful management of personal
data, minimizing its collection and guaranteeing proper access control, encryption, and retention
policies.

Finally, the system must be designed for performance and scalability, as port operations involve large
volumes of data that must be processed in real time. This includes ensuring low latency in scheduling
algorithms, efficient database queries, and the ability to handle concurrent access by multiple users
without degradation of service. Combined, these non-functional requirements establish the
foundations for a robust, professional-grade prototype reflecting some standards and expectations of
real-world software development in mission-critical domains.
